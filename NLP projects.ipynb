I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n> The same\\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.

If you are uninterested, since I will\\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\\nkill them.\\n\\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\\n\\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\\n\\n#1\\tBRIAN HAYWARD\\t\\tSeason:\\t11th\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tP (D)\\n\\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\\n\\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\\n\\n#30\\tJEFF HACKETT\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

       "  'From: jer@prefect.cc.bellcore.com (rathmann,janice e)\\nSubject: Re: Sinus vs. Migraine (was Re: Sinus Endoscopy)\\nOrganization: Bellcore, Livingston, NJ\\nSummary: Headaches and analgesics\\nLines: 95\\n\\n\\nI noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\\nI generally don\\'t take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I\\'ve\\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I\\'ve tried Synarel, it reduced\\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don\\'t expect to have\\nany more children, I don\\'t like the idea of having my uterus and\\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\\nto have children.  So basically all I\\'m left with is toughing out\\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn\\'t work, and Motrin gave me\\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I\\'m through with it).  In\\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \\nlegs) as I\\'ll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it\\'s actually quite effective\\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\\nI\\'m frequently in severe pain.\\n\\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I\\'ve had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\\n(I\\'ve had 2 of them, and don\\'t intend to ever do that again) with\\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I\\'d \\nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don\\'t have\\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\\n\\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can\\'t avoid them entirely because\\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\\nbut I\\'m avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\\na reduced capacity (I\\'m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can\\'t concentrate much,\\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\\nI can\\'t really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\\nI\\'ve taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\\nI reduced the dosage), but I don\\'t like the side effects (if I take\\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn\\'t very helpful when\\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I\\'ve tried several other medications\\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\\nthey either didn\\'t work, or I couldn\\'t tolerate them.  So what can I do?\\nMy doctor\\'s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\\npain.  I\\'ve had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\\nsuccinylcholine), and I\\'ve already had surgery several times.\\n\\nAnyway, the point of what I\\'m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\\n\\nJanice Rathmann\\n\\n',\n",

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.

I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

Jason was the FLYERS\\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\\nold, 6\\'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\\nup front as well.\\n\\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey.

The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\\n\\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\\nof taking the shot he found Brind\\'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa\\'s body should have been a\\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\\n\\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\\naway every rebound.\\n\\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind\\'Amour\\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\\n\\nThe Leafs couldn\\'t get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\\n\\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf\\'s blue line. They were in\\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\\n\\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\\ntripped up Rod Brind\\'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\\nBobby Clarke\\'s 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\\n\\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood\\'s\\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\\n\\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn\\'t\\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\\nlittle.\\n\\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\\nperiod, but couldn\\'t get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \\n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\\n\\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\\n\\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it\\'s side, and\\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind\\'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\\nequal and preserved the shutout.\\n\\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\\nhis stick across McGill\\'s face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\\n\\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind\\'Amour played catch until\\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\\n\\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I\\'ve seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\\nthe NHL, but he\\'s played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can\\'t\\nremember that he\\'s tied with.\\n\\nNext up it\\'s the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\\nin Washington would be the official end.\\n\\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\\nthan 5 under in 80).\\n\\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\\n\\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\\n on the 1-3 goal.\\n\\n Lines information follows further below.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\\n 3rd:\\n\\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\\n Attendance: 3,500\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Group B results:\\n\\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\\n\\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\\n Attendance: 10,200\\n\\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\\n\\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\\n Attendance: 2,800\\n\\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\\n whole game).

(Your greatly \\n          expanded Aura energy-field during that time could disrupt \\n          other people\\'s fields.)  Two hours after the bath, eat at \\n          least 8 ounces of yogurt containing ACTIVE Yogurt Cultures.  \\n          (The bath may kill FRIENDLY bacteria also.)  Better yet, take \\n          a 2-Billion-bacteria \"Acidophilus\" capsule, which is also an \\n          EXCELLENT DAILY REMEDY AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF \"A.I.D.S.\" \\n          (because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the \\n          digestive tract, taking a big load off the remaining immune \\n          system).  [Because this external bath can kill IN-ternal \\n          bacteria, it may also be a CURE for \"Lyme disease\".]\\n          Do NOT take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder \\n          storm, within 3 days of a full moon, nor during \"Major\" or \\n          \"Minor Periods\" as listed in the \"Solunar Tables\" published \\n          bimonthly in \"Field & Stream\" Magazine, (because of the \\n          measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy-fields \\n          present at those times).\\n          Do NOT take this bath more than four times per year. \\n       \\n          (5) MISCELLANEOUS NATURAL ANTI-CANCER REMEDIES: \\n       \\n               For skin cancer, apply STABILIZED Aloe Vera Jel to the \\n               affected skin twice daily, and take 2 to 4 tablespoons \\n               per day of STABILIZED Aloe Vera Juice internally, for \\n               about 2 months. \\n        \\n               D.M.S.O. (Dimethyl Sulfoxide) causes cancer cells to \\n               perform NORMAL cell functions. \\n\\n               ALMONDS (UN-blanched, UN-roasted) CONTAIN LAETRILE.  \\n               To help prevent cancer, eat several almonds every day.  \\n               To help cure cancer, eat several OUNCES of almonds per \\n               day.\\n               [NEVER take large concentrated doses of Laetrile orally.  \\n               IT WILL KILL YOU!  Take it INTRAVENOUSLY ONLY.  (Cancer \\n               cells contain a certain enzyme which converts Laetrile \\n               into cyanide, which then kills the cell.  This enzyme is \\n               ALSO present in the digestive system.)] \\n\\n               ANTI-OXIDANTS are FREE-RADICAL SCAVENGERS, and include \\n               Vitamin E, Selenium (200 mcg. per day is safe for most \\n               people.), Chromium (up to 100 mcg. per day), Vitamin A \\n               (25,000 IU per day is safe for most people.), Superoxide \\n               Dismutase (up to 4,000,000 Units per day), Vitamin C (up \\n               to 3000 mg. per day), and BHT (Butylated Hydroxy-\\n               toluene), [1 to 4 capsules of BHT every night at bedtime \\n               will also MAKE ONE IMMUNE AGAINST HERPES (BOTH types), \\n               suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes, \\n               prevent spreading herpes to other people, but will not \\n               cure herpes.

Dilute twelve(12) drops of 3% \\n               hydrogen-peroxide in a glass of pure water (preferably \\n               DISTILLED) and drink it.  Do this once or twice per day, \\n               hours before or after eating or drinking anything else.  \\n               Apply 3% hydrogen-peroxide directly to skin cancers \\n               several times per day.\\n               Use hydrogen-peroxide ONLY if you are taking a good \\n               daily dose of some of the various anti-oxidants \\n               described above. \\n\\n               VITAMIN & MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS are more effective, and \\n               much less expensive, when COMBINED together in MEGA \\n               doses into SINGLE tablets made from NATURAL sources. \\n\\n               Cancer cells can NOT live in a strong (100,000 Maxwell) \\n               NORTH MAGNETIC FIELD, especially if it is pulsating on \\n               and off.  [A strong south magnetic field is an \\n               aphrodisiac.]  In my opinion, ALL types of ionizing-\\n               radiation treatments for cancer should be REPLACED with \\n               daily 30-minute doses of pulsating 100,000-Maxwell NORTH \\n               magnetic fields. \\n\\n               Properly made and operated RADIONICS/PSIONICS MACHINES \\n               can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer, as well \\n               as most other medical problems.  Some Radionics/Psionics \\n               Machines can even take cross-sectional X-ray-like photos \\n               of cancer tumors, etc., with-OUT X-rays! \\n\\n               INTERFERON tablets.\\n\\n               TAHEEBO TEA, (Lapacho). \\n           \\n               HOMEOPATHY can cure cancer, and many other medical \\n               problems (even drug addiction!). \\n\\n               50 mg. per day of CHELATED ZINC can help prevent or cure \\n               prostate trouble. \\n\\n               This list is NOT exhaustive. \\n\\n\\n          The above NATURAL Remedies can CURE both diagnosed AND UN-\\n          DIAGNOSED cancers, as well as PREVENT them, and also prevent \\n          and cure many other medical problems including heart-\\n          diseases.

After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \\n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\\n\\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \\n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \\n\\n My questions are: \\n\\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\\n     levels of pain?\\n\\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\\n\\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\\n\\n\\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\\n  \\n  \\n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\\n\\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\\n   \\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nGregory W.

If you have an obvious hernia sac coming down \\ninto your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by\\nincreasing intra-abdominal pressure....\\nSometimes is not that obvious. The hernia is small and you can only \\ndetect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal. \\nWhether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous\\noperation, I can\\'t tell you. The person that examined you is in  the best\\nposition to make that determination.\\n\\nAre there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? Every now and then \\nfolks write about CT scans and ultrasounds for this. But these are far\\ntoo expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.\\n\\n\\n====================================\\n\\nHoward Doyle\\ndoyle+@pitt.edu\\n',\n",

My point is that quite frequently\\n(perhaps even most frequently) the roots of a new theory can be traced to\\npreviously existing theories (or even to previously rejected hypotheses of\\nsome other theory or domain).  I would offer some rather well known examples\\nsuch as Toricelli\\'s Puy de Dome experiment done for the sake of his \"sea of air\"\\nhypothesis.  Was this theory (and the resulting experimental test) \"surprising\"?\\nWell, given the *prior* explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must\\nbe counted as so.  Was the theory constructed (and the experiment designed)\\nout of \"perfectly rational grounds\"?  Well, there was a pretty successful and\\nwell know theory of fluids.  The analogy to fluids by Toricelli is explicit.\\nThe novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid (but this was *quite* a novelty\\nat the time).  Was the theory interesting?  Yes.  Was it \"new\"?  Well, one\\ncould argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new\\ndomain, but I think this begs certain questions.  We can debate that if you\\nlike.\\n-- \\nGary H.

We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \\n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\\n;we?\\n \\nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \\n1) reducing the gene pool and \\n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\\n \\nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\\ndon\\'t really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \\n \\nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\\nas no different than anyone else\\'s. But if we could make\\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\\n\"1984.\"   \\n \\nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\\nhasn\\'t stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\\nturns came.\\n \\nNot that I don\\'t think that this gene altering power couldn\\'t wipe us off\\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \\n \\nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don\\'t think\\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\\nmay not. If we don\\'t, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\\npull us through. \\n \\nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\\nthus far, or else haven\\'t had enough power for long enough. \\n \\nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn\\'t the power, it is the\\nSpirit.\\n \\nSorry for the long post.

But that is\\nonly for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with\\ninjuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really\\nrather be playing golf, don\\'t really give a damn.  Of course I can\\'t say this\\nfor sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I\\ndon\\'t think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically\\nhuman attitudes.  \\n\\nWith the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing \\nmoney by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff\\n\"take\" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely\\nto consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are\\ngoing to come back with \"winning spirit\" and all of that crap but these\\nplayers are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the \\ngame that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make\\na decent living. \\n\\nOf course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is \\nbeing paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his\\njob well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.\\n\\nThe second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions\\nof the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top \\nafter the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely\\naccord victory to the team that has remained healthy and \"hot\".  The \\nemphasis on the playoffs, with their \"sudden death\" appeal has been promoted\\nby the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh\\nloses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the\\nleague over the year.

These are the physicians \\nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \\nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med.

Those that were \\nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \\nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \\nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \\nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \\neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \\naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\\'s use of vitamin \\nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \\nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \\ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart\\'s content.

If lots of n-6 FAs are\\nconsumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \"bad\" prostanoid\\nproducts to \"good\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \"bad.\"\\nIsn\\'t this ratio the issue?\\n\\nWhat\\'s the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA\\nsupplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs\\nappear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the\\nlow absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).\\n\\n-Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>\\n\\n',\n",

Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.

I say seven because the\\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\\n\\n>Campbell Conference, Norris Division, semifinal\\n\\n>Chicago vs. St. Louis (or Minnesota):\\n> BLACKHAWKS IN 5.\\n\\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.

RED WINGS IN 5.\\n\\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \\nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\\n\\n>FINAL:\\n>Chicago vs. Detroit:\\n> This will be a war. Fedorov will win it in OT. RED WINGS IN 7.\\n\\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \\nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\\n\\n>Smythe Division SEMI-FINALS:\\n\\n>Vancouver vs. Winnipeg:\\n> CANUCKS IN 7.\\n\\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\\n\\n>Calgary vs. Los Angeles:\\n>This would have been tough to call, except for three things. 1/ The\\n>Kings don't have a goalie; 2/ Gary Roberts will be back; 3/ the Kings\\n>shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (Paul Coffey)\\n>for a proven loser (Jimmy Carson).

LA in six.\\n\\n>FINAL:\\n>Vancouver vs. Calgary:\\n> FLAMES IN 6.\\n\\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.

Reproduced without permission.]\\n\\n\\n\\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\\n\\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \\nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \\n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\\nsour as well.\\n\\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\\n\\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We \\nawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.\\n\\n[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]\\n\\n\\nRefs:  \\n\\nBartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,\\nI only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I\\nestimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.\\n\\nVery little sugar or salt.\\n\\nVery high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are\\nrecommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I\\'ve heard\\nof people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can\\ncontain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as\\nlikely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are\\njust too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)\\n\\nMy \"clean your plate\" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last\\n10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch\\nup, so I don\\'t still feel hungry and go start eating something else.\\n\\nI don\\'t eat when I\\'m not hungry (unless I\\'m sure I\\'ll get hungry\\nshortly, and eating won\\'t be practical then).\\n\\nI bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to\\nstores, movies, and everywhere else, as I\\'ve never owned a car.\\nI estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps\\nbuild and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes\\nruns in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my\\nmetabolism is so low that when I\\'m at rest I\\'m most comfortable\\nwith a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if\\nit drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess\\nounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that\\nweigh slightly less than others.  But it\\'s easier and cheaper to trim\\nweight from the rider than from the vehicle.)\\n\\nThere\\'s no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically\\ndifferent from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,\\nit isn\\'t different in a way that precludes excellent health.\\n\\nObviously, I can\\'t swear that every obese person who does what I\\'ve\\ndone will have the success I did.  But I\\'ve never yet heard of one who\\ndid try it and didn\\'t succeed.\\n\\n> I think all of us cycle.  One\\'s success depends on how large the\\n> fluctuations in the cycle are.  Some people can cycle only 5 pounds.\\n\\nI\\'m sure everyone\\'s weight cycles, whether or not they\\'ve ever been fat.\\nI usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,\\nmy weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes\\noff again over a week or two.\\n-- \\nKeith Lynch, kfl@access.digex.com\\n\\nf p=2,3:2 s q=1 x \"f f=3:2 q:f*f>p!\\'q  s q=p#f\" w:q p,?$x\\\\8+1*8\\n',\n",

(To\\n>reuse the previous example, we know that conclusions from\\n>uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical\\n>problems are notoriously problematic.)  \\n\\nOkay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\nof certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\ncontrolled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\nextent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\ntreatment. On the other hand, highly favorable clinical experience, even \\nif uncontrolled, can be adequate to justify a *preliminary* judgement that\\na treatment is useful.  This is often the best evidence we can hope for\\nfrom investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support.\\nIn this case, it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible\\nbut to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are\\nqualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing.\\n\\nSECONDLY, it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of \\nevidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal.  \\n\\n\\nI come to this dispute about what science is  not only as a\\nmathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci.psychology (and\\noccasionally in sci.med) about NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming).  Much\\nof the work done to date by NLPers can be better categorized as\\ninformal exploration than as careful scientific research.  For years\\nnow I have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to\\njust take a look at it, to read a few of the books and watch some of\\nthe videotapes (courtesy of your local university library).  Not for\\nthe purpose of making a definitive judgement, but simply to look at the\\nNLP methodology (especially the approach to eliciting information from\\nsubjects) and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of\\nscientific interest.  And most especially to be aware of the\\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\\nhasn\\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\\nresearch then it can\\'t be of any interest to us.\"  \\n\\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There\\'ve got to\\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\\n\\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\\'s most \\nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \\nit doesn\\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \\nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \\nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\\nprocess doesn\\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\\'t need to\\npractice it over again at home.\\n\\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \\n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \\nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \\nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \\nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \\nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \\nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \\nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \\neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \\nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \\nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \\nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \\n\\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\nfrom scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \\npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don\\'t have any way of \\nknowing that it\\'s effective.\"  \\n\\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \\nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \\ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \\nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\\'s described in a number of \\nbooks and I\\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \\ndetail as I\\'m capable of.)  \\n\\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \\nfavorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because it\\'s a\\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \\nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \\nattitudes about science.  \\n\\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \\nIf so, I apologize. \\n \\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\\n\\nI\\'ve never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\\n\\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\\n   water.\\n\\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\\n\\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\\n\\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\\nstory here.\\n\\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\\n\\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim\\'s body fluids\\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim\\'s weight will increase by\\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\\nthe victim\\'s urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test\\ninvolving the specific gravity of a body fluid?\\n\\nPaul.\\n-- \\nPaul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).\\t    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245\\n--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------\\nThese ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is not\\nfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions\\n',\n",

The goalie\\nwho gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series\\nfor his team.\\n\\nEposode Summary\\n---------------\\nThis episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that\\nhe bought from the concession stand.\\n\\nRon Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the\\nToronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow\\nand proclaimed \"Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks\\nof me. Beauty.\"\\n\\nNext, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to\\nhim, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all\\nthe arenas in the NHL.\\n\\nFrom there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game\\nhad great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game\\nin the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All\\nstop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary\\nby Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most\\npenalties gets to ref in the finals.\\n\\nNext, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for\\nthe Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the\\nwins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup\\nand the AHL championships.\\n\\nFinally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the\\nRangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.\\nDon feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had\\nseveral key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who\\nwent cold.\\n\\nDon had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party\\'s over,\\nAdolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer\\nbe a \\'country club\\'.... \"NY should be achamed of themselves... If\\nthey go in the tank with Adolf there, they\\'ll be hanging from the\\nyardarm by their thumbs.\"\\n\\n\\nRating\\n------\\nNothing too special in this episode.\\n\\nI\\'ll give it a 5.5 out of 10.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   \\\\  \\\\                   |Allan Sullivan (allan@cs.ualberta.ca)\\n    \\\\  \\\\                  |Department of Computing Science,\\n     \\\\  \\\\_______          |University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\\n      \\\\    ###  \\\\     _   |---------------------------------------------------\\n       \\\\___###___\\\\   (_)  |My opinions are mine and mine alone.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished if no one cares who gets the\\n credit...\"          - U. of A.

McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the\\ncrowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-\\nistically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they\\nstill go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the\\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \\nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \\nexamples of players that real fans know aren\\'t worth a damn and yet, being\\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\\n\\n>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \\n>>true.

Wordscan Plus is a product of Calera Recognition Systems.  \\nIt runs under Windows 3.1 and supports that Accufont Technology of the Hewlett \\nPackard Scanners.  \\n\\nWhen initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; \\n(1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) \\nautomatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. \\n\\nI like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which \\nparts of the document I would like scanned, and in what order.\\n\\nOnce an image is scanned, you can bring up the Pop-Up image verification.  The \\nsoftware gives you two \"errors\" at this point.  Blue which are words that were \\nconverted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  \\nYellow shade, which are words that Wordscan Plus doesn\\'t think it converted \\ncorrectly at all.  I have found that the software should give itself more \\ncredit.  It is usually correct, instead of wrong.  If a word is shaded blue, \\nyou can add it to your personal dictionary.  The only problem is the personal \\ndictionary will only handle about 200 words.  I find this to be very limited, \\nconsidering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. \\n\\nAfter a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word \\nprocessor formats.

Since the early 1970s, the U.S. public health system has \\nbeen challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., \\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, \\nLegionnaires disease, Lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). The incidences \\nof many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, \\nmalaria, and tuberculosis (TB), have increased in many areas. Furthermore, \\ncontrol and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug \\nresistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, \\nsalmonellosis, shigellosis, TB, and staphylococcal infections (2). Emerging \\ninfections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those \\nin institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and \\nminority and underserved populations. The substantial economic burden of \\nemerging infections on the U.S. health-care system could be reduced by more \\neffective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs \\n(3). \\n     This issue of MMWR introduces a new series, \"Emerging Infectious \\nDiseases.\" Future articles will address these diseases, as well as \\nsurveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and \\npublic health officials. This first article updates the ongoing investigation \\nof an outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in the western United States (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1. Burnet M. Natural history of infectious disease.

Washington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a physician reported to the Washington Department of \\nHealth a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrease in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\ncase-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or \\npostdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls \\nimplicated eating at chain A restaurants during the week before symptom onset \\n(matched odds ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain A restaurants \\nwas initiated. \\n     As a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\nstate health department. A total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or postdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding onset of \\nsymptoms. Of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nrestaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. Of the 338 patients \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular-sized hamburger patty. Onsets of illness peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patients was 7.5 years \\n(range: 0-74 years). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Washington, the Division of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illness onset dates from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four persons were \\nhospitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illness onset, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A restaurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Services was \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who subsequently died. \\nActive surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infections or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A restaurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B restaurant in San Diego. After the Washington outbreak was \\nreported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% \\nincrease in visits or admissions for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. A case was defined as \\npostdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. Fourteen \\npersons were hospitalized, seven developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). A case-control study of \\nthe first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community \\ncontrols implicated eating at a chain A restaurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A study comparing case-patients \\nwho ate at chain A restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-\\nsized hamburger patties (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B was not statistically associated with illness. Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A restaurant, the Clark County (Las Vegas) Health District \\nissued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A case was defined as postdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness \\nwith a stool culture yielding the Washington strain of E. coli O157:H7, with \\nonset from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Because local \\nlaboratories were not using sorbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to screen stools \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, this organism was not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of \\none patient 38 days after illness onset. \\n     Of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere hospitalized; three developed HUS. The median age was 30.5 years (range: \\n0-83 years). Analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-\\nmatched community controls implicated eating at a chain A restaurant during \\nthe week preceding illness onset (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients \\nalso implicated eating hamburgers at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Investigation Findings \\n     During the outbreak, chain A restaurants in Washington linked with cases \\nprimarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on November \\n19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in \"jumbo\" patties produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992. The outbreak strain of E. coli O157:H7 was isolated from 11 \\nlots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed \\nto restaurants in all states where illness occurred. Approximately 272,672 \\n(20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. \\n     A meat traceback by a CDC team identified five slaughter plants in the \\nUnited States and one in Canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\ncontaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing \\nthe likelihood of contamination. The animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter \\nplants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. No one \\nslaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. \\n     Further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in \\nfamilies and child day care settings is ongoing. \\n\\nReported by: M Davis, DVM, C Osaki, MSPH, Seattle-King County Dept of Public \\nHealth; D Gordon, MS, MW Hinds, MD, Snohomish Health District, Everett; K \\nMottram, C Winegar, MPH, Tacoma-Pierce County Health Dept; ED Avner, MD, PI \\nTarr, MD, Dept of Pediatrics, D Jardine, MD, Depts of Anesthesiology and \\nPediatrics, Univ of Washington School of Medicine and Children\\'s Hospital and \\nMedical Center, Seattle; M Goldoft, MD, B Bartleson, MPH; J Lewis, JM \\nKobayashi, MD, State Epidemiologist, Washington Dept of Health.

This pathogen has since \\nemerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and HUS, the most common \\ncause of acute renal failure in children. Outbreak investigations have linked \\nmost cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other \\nfood vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been \\nimplicated (3). Preliminary data from a CDC 2-year, nationwide, multicenter \\nstudy revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for E. coli O157:H7 \\nthat organism was isolated more frequently than Shigella in four of 10 \\nparticipating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a \\nhigher rate than for any other pathogen. \\n     Infection with E. coli O157:H7 often is not recognized because most \\nclinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  7\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nSMAC medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses \\nassociated with infection (4). The usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea \\n(often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. Younger age groups \\nand the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and \\ncomplications. Illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients \\ndevelop HUS, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     This report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community \\noutbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 in the absence of routine surveillance. Despite \\nthe magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in Washington \\n(1). Clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from \\npersons with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 using SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infections with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they should be reported \\nto local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further cases. \\n     E. coli O157:H7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during slaughter. CDC is collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture\\'s Food Safety Inspection Service to identify \\ncritical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat supply. \\nBecause slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens \\nfrom the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice is to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices \\nare clear. In this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued interim \\nrecommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, personal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report \\nand the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be \\nconsumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of \\noutbreaks. The public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of \\nthis pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections \\ncaused by E. coli O157:H7 and for HUS to better define the epidemiology of E. \\ncoli O157:H7. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Long-term use of \\nsmokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of \\noral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who \\ncurrently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). \\nTo monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, \\nCDC\\'s 1991 National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion and Disease \\nPrevention supplement (NHIS-HPDP) collected information on snuff and chewing \\ntobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, \\nnoninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. This \\nreport summarizes findings from this survey. \\n     The 1991 NHIS-HPDP supplement asked \"Have you used snuff at least 20 \\ntimes in your entire life?\" and \"Do you use snuff now?\" Similar questions were \\nasked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. Current users of \\nsmokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco \\nuse at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the \\ntime of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having \\nused snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the \\ntime of the interview. Ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and \\nformer users. Current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at \\nleast 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as \\nthose who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not \\nsmoking now. Ever smokers included current and former smokers. Data on \\nsmokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or \\nequal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide \\nnational estimates. Confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using \\nstandard errors generated by the Software for Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) \\n(3). \\n     In 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) U.S. adults were current users \\nof smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) \\nwomen. For all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco \\nuse was substantially higher among men. For men, the prevalence of use was \\nhighest among those aged 18-24 years (Table 1); for women, the prevalence was \\nhighest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. The prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use among men was highest among American Indians/Alaskan \\nNatives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among American \\nIndians/Alaskan Natives and blacks. Among both men and women, prevalence of \\nsmokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. Prevalence was \\nsubstantially higher among residents of the southern United States and in \\nrural areas. Although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 10\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nmen and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only \\nfor women (p less than 0.05) (Table 1). \\n     Among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those \\naged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of \\nchewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (Table 2). Although \\nwomen rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest \\namong those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. \\n     An estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% CI=4.1-4.6) adults reported being \\nformer smokeless tobacco users. Among ever users, the proportion who were \\nformer smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% CI=57.7-62.1). Among persons \\naged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users \\n(56.2% 95% CI=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% \\nCI=64.2-76.6). Among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users \\nwas similar for snuff (68.9% 95% CI=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% \\n95% CI=68.9-78.1). \\n     Among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% CI=19.9-26.0) \\ncurrently smoked, 33.3% (95% CI=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% \\nCI=39.9-47.7) never smoked. In comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% \\nCI=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. \\n     Daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% \\n95% CI=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% CI=40.6-\\n49.6). \\n\\nReported by: Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease \\nPrevention and Health Promotion; Div of Health Interview Statistics, National \\nCenter for Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless \\ntobacco was highest among young males. Adolescent and young adult males, in \\nparticular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that \\nlink smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. Use of oral \\nsnuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this \\nbehavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for \\nnicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). \\n     Differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among \\nracial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels \\nand socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require \\nfurther explanation. For example, targeted marketing practices may play a role \\nin maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the \\ndifferential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). \\n     In this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current \\nsmokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. In the 1991 NHIS-HPDP, the \\nprevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco \\nusers than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. In a previous \\nstudy among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\noccasionally (7). In addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked \\nreported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to \\nstop smoking (8). Health-care providers should recognize the potential health \\nimplications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. \\n     The national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special \\npopulation target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless \\ntobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year \\n2000 objective 3.9) and American Indian/Alaskan Native youth (to no more \\nthan 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). Strategies to lower the \\nprevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless \\ntobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, \\nenforcing laws that restrict minors\\' access to tobacco, making excise taxes \\ncommensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to \\nroutinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based \\nprevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit \\ntobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \\nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \\ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \\nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\\'m going to state it again here.\\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \\nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\\n\\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \\nper day).\\n\\n\\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \\n\\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\\n\\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\\n\\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \\nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \\nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \\nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\\n\\n\\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \\n\\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\\n\\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \\n\\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\\n\\n\\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\\n\\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \\n\\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\\n\\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \\nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \\noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \\nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \\nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \\nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \\nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \\n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \\nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \\nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \\nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \\nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \\nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \\nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \\nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \\nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \\nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \\nbefore supplementation.\\n\\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \\nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\\'t know about \\nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \\nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \\nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \\nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \\nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \\nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \\ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \\nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \\nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \\nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \\nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \\nin urinary oxalate excretion.\\n\\n\\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\\n\\n\\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\\n\\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\\n\\n\\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \\n\\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\\n\\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\\n\\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \\nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \\nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \\nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \\nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\\'t \\nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \\nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \\nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \\n\\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \\nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \\nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \\nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \\neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \\nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \\nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \\nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \\nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \\nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \\ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \\nformation should be given B6 supplements.\\n\\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \\nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \\ncalcium-oxalate.\\n\\n\\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \\npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n        2. X terminals\\n        3. NeXT\\n        4. Silicon Graphics\\n        5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\t6. Other stuff\\n\\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\\n\\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\\'re going to have a hard time finding\\n\\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\\n\\truns the X window system, you\\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\\n\\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\\n\\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\\n\\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\\n\\n\\tThe two main programs I\\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\\n\\n\\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\\n\\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\\n\\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\\n\\tserver can do this, run \\'xdpyinfo\\' and see if any of these strings\\n\\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\\'t have this,\\n\\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\\n\\tor bugging your vendor.\\n\\n\\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\\n\\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\n\\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n    2. X terminals\\n\\n\\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\\n\\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\\n\\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\\n\\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\\n\\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\\n\\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\\n\\n    3. NeXT\\n\\n\\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\\n\\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\\n\\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\\n\\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\\n\\n    4. Silicon Graphics\\n\\n\\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\\n\\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\\'s not\\n\\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\\n\\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\\n\\tdetails.\\n\\n    5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\n\\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\\n\\tUnfortunately, you can\\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\\n\\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\\n\\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\\n\\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\\n\\tworks.  However, they don\\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\\'ve been  ||\\n\\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\\n\\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\\t\\t\\t\\t    ||\\n    \\n    6. Other stuff\\n\\n\\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\\n\\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\\n\\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\\n\\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\\n\\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\\n\\tluck.

       "  'From: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier)\\nSubject: Critique of Pressure Point Massager\\nOriginator: robin@volans\\nNntp-Posting-Host: volans\\nReply-To: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier)\\nOrganization: Northern Telecom Inc, Mountain View, CA\\nDistribution: na\\nLines: 141\\n\\nAs promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager \\nI recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with \\nthe results.  The catalog description is as follows:\\n\\n\\tThe Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager \\n\\tthat actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a\\n\\tprofessional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two\\n\\tcounter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --\\n\\treleasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.\\n\\n\\tPressure Point Massager    A2623   $109\\n\\nTo order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or\\nfax at 1-800-345-4021.\\n\\n********\\nNOTE:\\nWhen I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price\\nwas $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog\\nenclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was  \\nQUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it,\\nand the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it\\nlooks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the\\nfirst one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a\\nreason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to\\nship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could \\nuse the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old \\none.  VERY reasonable people.\\n********\\n\\nI have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I \\nwould be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches \\nand exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.  \\nIf, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough\\ntime, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus, \\nmore prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require \\nphysical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit \\nto get the prescription for p.t.  \\n\\nThe tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache\\n(sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my \\nphysical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles \\nin particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the \\nheadache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to \\nwhile it is being massaged.\\n\\nI ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing\\nsomeone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my \\nneck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in \\nthe past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient \\np.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up \\nin the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.\\n\\nI have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base\\nunit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each\\nside, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about \\n1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs \\nare covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more \\ntoward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in \\neither clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side \\nof the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either\\nside.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck\\nor the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.\\n\\n\\n                 _______________________________\\n                |  __    _______________    __  |\\n                | |  |  |\\t\\t|  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |  \\\\^^/   \\\\^^/  |  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |\\t\\t|  |  | |\\n                | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |\\n                | |__|\\t\\t\\t   |__| |\\n                |_______________________________|\\n\\n\\nFor the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if \\nlaying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or \\nneck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or\\nstanding, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are\\nalso impaired (I\\'m typing this over an extended period of time), and I \\ndon\\'t have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works \\nwell for me.\\n\\nFor my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager\\nbehind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or\\nnot so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.  \\nIf I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches \\nwhenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use \\nthan the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together \\n(with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and \\nmove the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than \\nnothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are \\nnot in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don\\'t \\npin it up first.  As far as I\\'m concerned, the easier something like this \\nis to use, the more likely I\\'ll use/do it.  If there are multiple \\nconsiderations/hassles, I\\'m more likely to not bother with it.\\n\\nNot only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion \\nfor my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my\\nneck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard\\nagainst it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a\\nfew days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.  \\nAfter that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point, \\nthe pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.  \\nI also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the \\nmost vulnerable point for me.\\n\\nIt also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades,\\nalthough, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at\\na time) to really work it out.\\n\\nI highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I\\ncannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I\\'ve had\\nit such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also \\nto loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have\\nbeen ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this \\nwas very timely  for me.\\n\\nThis is the 1st product I\\'ve ordered from this company and only recently\\nbecame aware of it thru a co-worker.

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team.

Previous offers for \\nthe position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of\\nBrown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.\\n\\nUMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had\\nundermined the team's position over a period of years.

Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or\\npotential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will\\nleverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and\\nEurope to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.\\n\\nUMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; \\nexpect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.\\n\\n....

But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".

The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.

Hope you can join us.\\n\\n\\nOn Saturday, April 24 as part of Communiversity in Princeton, a local family  \\nwill be having a bake and craft sale to raise money for and create public  \\nawareness about a rare disease called Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis.\\n\\nBill and Marlene Stern's daughter Lindsay is afflicted with this disease  \\ncharacterized by tumors attacking the inside of the larynx, vocal cords and  \\ntrachea.  Caused by a virus, the tumors grow, block the air passages and would  \\nlead to death from suffocation without continual surgery to remove the growths.   \\nThree year old Lindsay has undergone 11 operations thus far since her diagnosis  \\nlast year and faces the prospect of over a hundred operations throughout her  \\nlifetime.  \\n\\nEven though the disease is hardly a household word, it has affected the lives  \\nof enough people to inspire the formation of the Recurrent Respiratory  \\nPapillomatosis Foundation,  a non-profit foundation whose goals are to provide  \\nsupport for patients and families by networking patients and publishing a  \\nnewsletter, enhance  awareness of RRP at the local and national level, and aid  \\nin the prevention, cure, and treatment.\\n\\nSince medical researchers know that the virus causing the disease is similar to  \\nthose viruses causing warts, they feel a cure would be within reach if money  \\nwere available for research.  Because RRP is rare, it not only gets scant  \\nattention but also paltry funds to search for a cure.  Part of the RRP  \\nFoundation's mission is to change that. \\n\\nAnyone interested in contributing items to the bake and craft sale, please call  \\nMarlene or Bill at 609-890-0502.  Monetary donations can be made at the  \\nFoundation's booth during Communiversity, April 24th, 12 to 4 p.m., in downtown  \\nPrinceton, or sent directly to:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Recurrent Respiratory Foundation\\n\\t                50 Wesleyan Drive\\n\\t                Hamilton Sq., NJ  08690.\\nThanks   mstern@lindsay.princeton.edu\\n\",\n",

It is interesting\\nmedically because the normal location of organs is caused in part\\nby the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in\\nabsence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs\\ninversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their\\nrarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they\\ncan\\'t find the patient\\'s heart sounds (because they\\'re on the wrong\\nside). \\n\\nAccording to Harrison\\'s, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal\\nrecessive, which should imply that on average one child in four\\nin a family would be affected. But there may be much more current\\ninformation on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking\\nabout more than one conditiion.

Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that\\nwould *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. \\nHextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...\\nBoth Dionne\\'s and Bellows\\' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because\\nhis gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head \\nfor the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from \\nend-to-end. Kamensky\\'s mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by \\nYoung in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall \\nfor most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero \\nbecause Roy\\'s team didn\\'t make full use of their opportunities.\\n\\nHextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very \\nwell, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over \\nBellows\\' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all \\nthose opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.\\nHextall wasn\\'t particularly brilliant on those plays ... \\n\\n>Blaming Stewart is just an\\n>excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst\\n>goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.\\n\\nSure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against\\nan explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with\\na powerplay that was totally unnecessary.\\n\\n>Montreal played a solid game (although they still don\\'t know how to clear\\n>traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). \\n\\nI disagree. Roy played well because he wasn\\'t screened the whole night. \\nThe defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,\\nNolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.\\n\\n>Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than \\n>five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME \\n>ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads. But I don\\'t\\n>think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear \\n>the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  \\n\\nThis most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,\\nas did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau\\nwere *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave\\nup the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.\\n\\n>Roy is paid big money to \\n>play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic\\'s shot.\\n\\nAnd Hextall didn\\'t on Dionne\\'s goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because\\nthat is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,\\nwhen you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him\\nfor most of the season.\\n\\n>Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let\\n>the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this\\n>article, if possible.\\n\\nThe Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory\\ncomments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should\\nthey read the papers? They played 58 minutes of \"Burnsian\" hockey to shut\\ndown Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the \\nextra 2.\\n\\nRed Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That\\'s a guaranteed way to end the\\nseries 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?\\nThe fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.\\n\\n>I didn\\'t think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn\\'t\\n>think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can\\'t remember who)\\n>in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn\\'t have gone in\\n>regardless.\\n\\nIf you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never\\nhave been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work\\nby Young.

Dr. Noordewier has \\nappointments in both Computer Science and Biology at Rutgers, and \\nhas extensive experience in basic biological research in addition \\nto his current work in computational biology.\\n\\n12:00-2:45pm \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence for \\n Biologists\"  Dr. Richard Lathrop (MIT & Arris Corp.)\\n\\nAn overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be \\npresented, as it relates to actual and potential biological \\napplications.  Fundamental techniques, symbolic programming \\nlanguages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as \\nselected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge \\nrepresentation, inference, and machine learning.  The intended \\naudience includes biologists with some computational background, \\nbut no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  Dr. \\nLathrop, co-developer of ARIADNE and related technologies, has \\nworked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to \\nbiological problems in both academia and industry.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Neural Networks, Statistics, and Information Theory \\n in Biological Sequence Analysis\" Dr. Alan Lapedes (Los Alamos \\n National Laboratory) \\n\\nThis tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of \\nintelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine \\nlearning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  Closely \\ninterrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical \\nneural networks to elicit both specific signals and general \\ncharacteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such \\napproaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic \\nviews of sequence data.  Dr. Lapedes, of the Theoretical \\nDivision at Los Alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such \\ntechniques in this domain.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Genetic Algorithms and Genetic Programming\" \\n Prof. John Koza (Stanford University)\\n\\nThe genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly \\nnon-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally \\ninspired by a biological metaphor.  This tutorial will cover both \\nthe biological motivations, and the actual implementation and \\ncharacteristics of the algorithm.  Genetic Programming, an \\nextension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size \\nand shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will \\nalso be addressed.  Particular attention will be paid to \\nbiological applications, and to identifying resources and software \\nthat will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  Dr. Koza, \\na Consulting Professor of Computer Science at Stanford, has taught \\nthis subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in \\nthe field.\\n\\n3:00-5:45pm \"Linguistic Methods in Sequence Analysis\" \\n Prof. David Searls (University of Pennsylvania) \\n & Shmuel Pietrokovski (Weizmann Institute)\\n\\nApproaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies \\nare increasingly in evidence.  These involve the adaptation of \\ntools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic \\npattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of \\ngenetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the \\nidentification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes \\nin sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and \\nfunctional relatedness.  Dr. Searls, who holds research faculty \\nappointments in both Genetics and Computer Science at Penn, \\nrepresents the branch of this field that considers higher-order \\nsyntactic approaches to sequence data, while Shmuel Pietrokovski \\nhas studied and published with Prof. Edward Trifinov in the area \\nof word-based analyses.\\n\\n                      REGISTRATION FORM\\nMail, with check made out to \"ISMB-93\", to:\\n\\n               ISMB Conference, c/o J.

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32\\nalternative health therapies.]\\n\\n  ...the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the\\n  1950s.  Using alternating currents of high frequency to \\'illuminate\\'\\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\\n  were subject to changes.  The object\\'s life activity was also visible in\\n  highly variable colour patterns.\\n\\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\\n\\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people\\'s\\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\\n  isn\\'t actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\\n\\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can \\'see\\'\\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\\n  can\\'t possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\\n  the actual object itself.\\n\\n  [...]\\n\\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally \\'charged\\' by a healer\\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\\n\\n\\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\\nconsumer\\'s guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\\nvNON4 p4(11).

Many paranormal\\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\\n  hobbyists for a century.  It took a lone basement crank to declare that\\n  the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura.  In fact, Kirlian\\n  photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O.\\n  Pehek, Harry J. Kyler, and David L. Faust, who reported their findings\\n  in the October 15, 1976, issue of Science.  Their conclusion: The\\n  variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on\\n  the surface of the body and not to mysterious \"auras\" or even\\n  necessarily to changes in mood or mental state.

Our \\nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \\nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \\ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \\nDr. Teperman. \\n\\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\\n\\n\\nLAST MEETING\\n\\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \\nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \\nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \\nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \\nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \\nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \\nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \\nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \\na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \\nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \\ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \\nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \\nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \\ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \\n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \\nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \\nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \\nher for an entertaining evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nANNUAL MEETING\\n\\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \\nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \\nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \\npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \\nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \\nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \\nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \\nslate for the Board.\\n\\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\\n\\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\\n\\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\\n\\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \\nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \\nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \\nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \\nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \\nmembers and there is plenty of work. \\n\\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \\ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \\nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\\n\\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \\nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\\n\\nFUTURE MEETINGS\\n\\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \\n\\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\\n\\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \\n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \\n\\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\\n\\nNOTDAW\\n\\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \\nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \\nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \\nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \\nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \\n\\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \\nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \\na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \\naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \\nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \\nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\\n\\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \\n\\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \\nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \\nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \\nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \\nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \\nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\\n\\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \\n\\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \\nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \\nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\\n\\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \\nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \\nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \\n     \\nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \\ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \\nand feeling better.  \\n\\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \\nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \\nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \\nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \\ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \\n\\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \\nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a \\ncandidate for the Board so we need her well soon.\\n \\nAnd best wishes to all coming out of the flu. It was a tough \\nwinter for many, but the tulips are just under the snow.\\n\\nSEE YOU......WEDNESDAY   APRIL 14  8 PM   K of C UNIONDALE            \\n                   DR.

There\\n>is a book \"The Yeast Connection\" which talks about this \"illness\".\\n>\\n>There is no convincing evidence that such a disease exists.\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot of evidence, it just hasn\\'t been adequately gathered and\\npublished in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics\\nwho quiver everytime the word \\'anecdote\\' or \\'empirical\\' is used.\\n\\nFor example, Dr. Ivker, who wrote the book \"Sinus Survival\", always gives,\\nbefore any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as Nizoral) to his\\nnew patients IF they\\'ve been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times\\nin the last two years.  He\\'s kept a record of the results, and for over \\n2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief\\nof allergic/sinus symptoms.  Of course, this is only the beginning for his\\nprogram.\\n\\nIn my case, as I reported a few weeks ago, I was developing the classic\\nsymptoms outlined in \\'The Yeast Connection\\' (I agree it is a poorly \\nwritten book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which\\nI never had before (started in November).  Within one week of full dosage\\nof Sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - I can\\nnow sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  I\\'m also\\n*greatly* improved in other areas as well.\\n\\nOf course, I have allergy symptoms, etc.  I am especially allergic to\\nmolds, yeasts, etc.  It doesn\\'t take a rocket scientist to figure out that\\nif one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a\\nnatural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you\\nwould have perceptible symptoms.  Also, yeast do produce toxins of various\\nsorts, and again, you don\\'t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that\\nsuch toxins can cause problems in some people.  In my case it was sinus\\nsince that\\'s the center of my allergic response.  Of course, the $60,000\\nquestion is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed I was\\nfrom over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the\\nstress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast\\ncolonization somewhere in the body.  It is a tough question to answer since\\ntesting for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  One almost has to\\ntake an empirical approach to diagnosis.  Fortunately, Sporanox is relatively\\nsafe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there\\'s\\nno reason any longer to withhold Sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.\\n\\nBTW, some would say to try Nystatin.  Unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae\\ntoo deep into tissue for Nystatin to have any permanent affect.  You\\'ll find\\na lot of people who are on Nystatin all the time.\\n\\nIn summary, I appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep\\nmedicine on the right road.  But methinks that some who hold too firmly\\nto the party line are academics who haven\\'t been in the trenches long enough\\nactually treating patients.  If anybody, doctors included, said to me to my\\nface that there is no evidence of the \\'yeast connection\\', I cannot guarantee\\ntheir safety.

Does anone have any information\\n\\nI\\'m not sure that this condition is \"recognised\" anywhere (in the\\nsense of a disease with diagnostic criteria, clear boundaries\\nbetween it and other diseases, unique pathologic or physiologic\\nfeatures, etc), but here goes with what many neurologists agree on.\\n\\nPost-polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease\\nby clinical examination, EMG, and muscle biopsy.  The abnormalities\\nare mostly chronic (due to old polio) but there is evidence of\\nongoing deterioration.  Clinically, the patients complain of\\ndeclining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks.\\nMusculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless\\ncontributes to the impaired performance.  The examination shows\\nmuscle weakness and atrophy.  The EMG shows evidence of old\\ndenervation with reinnervation (giant and long-duration motor unit\\naction potentials) *and* evidence of active denervation\\n(fibrillation potentials).  The biopsy also shows old denervation\\nwith reinnervation (fiber-type grouping) *and* evidence of active\\ndenervation (small, angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme\\nstaining) - but curiously, little or no group atrophy.\\n\\nPost-polio patients do not have ALS.  In ALS, there is clinically\\nevident deterioration from one month to the next.  In post-polio,\\nthe patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one\\nyear to the next.  Of course, there are patients who had polio\\nbefore who develop genuine ALS, but ALS is no more common among\\npolio survivors than among people who never had polio.\\n\\nThe cause of post-polio syndrome is unknown.  There is little\\nevidence that post-polio patients have active polio virus or\\ndestructive immunologic response to virus antigen.\\n\\nThere is no solid evidence that patients with post-polio have\\nanything different happening to the motor unit (anterior horn cells,\\nmotor axons, neuromuscular junctions, and muscle fibers) than\\npatients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration.\\nBoth groups can have the same EMG and biopsy findings.  The reason\\nfor these \"acute\" changes in a \"chronic\" disease (old polio) is\\nunknown.  Possibly spinal motor neurons (that have reinnervated huge\\nnumbers of muscle fibers) start shedding the load after several\\nyears.\\n\\nThere are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post-polio\\nsyndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny\\ndeterioration.  The PPS patients are more likely to have had severe\\npolio.  The PPS patients are *much* more likely to complain of pain.\\nThey also tend to score higher on depression scales of\\nneuropsychologic tests.\\n\\nMy take on this (I\\'m sure some will disagree):  after recovery from\\nsevere polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles, tendons,\\nligaments, bones, and joints, that leads to inflammatory and/or\\ndegenerative conditions affecting these structures.  The increasing\\npain, superimposed on the chronic (but unchanging) weakness, leads\\nto progressive impairment of motor performance and ADL.  I am\\nperhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a PPS\\npatient who was not limited in some way by pain.  I do not believe\\nthat PPS patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than\\nnon-PPS patients (i.e., those with old polio of similar severity but\\nwithout PPS complaints).\\n---\\n .

So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

Just wanted to glow a\\nlittle.\\n\\nI know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie\\'s out on the ice.\\nIn fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person\\nis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I\\'d probably\\nbe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.\\n\\nHe said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad\\nstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to\\nlearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took\\nthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived\\nin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn\\'t\\nand wouldn\\'t play a lick of defense.\\n\\nIt\\'s really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought\\nall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has\\ncertainly helped, and even ol\\' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at\\nthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up\\npermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it\\nwouldn\\'t matter.\\n\\nIf I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would\\nbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I\\'d love to put\\nFrancis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage\\nthe Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)\\n\\nMom.\\n\\n',\n",

The rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  \\nmuscular injections however--so if it\\'s a daily thing it would be\\nbest not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  Although\\nsome suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent \\nirritation.  When you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, \\nwait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the\\npuncture, and of course, that doesn\\'t feel good.  A way to prevent\\nirratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  A good way to\\ndo this is use a little round bandage and put it over the \\nspot.  This helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,\\nand spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 \" apart.)\\n\\nThis is from experience, so I hope it\\'ll help you.

It\\'s the one that sometimes sweeps\\nschools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking\\nthe covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose\\nand the brain to swell up.\\n\\nIt is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn\\'t much time,\\nhowever.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible\\nto dying from bacterial meningitis.

A6 \\n======================================================================   \\n\"Alternative Medicine Advocates Divided Over New NIH Research  Program\" AIDS \\nTreatment News (04/02/93) No. 172, P. 6  (Gilden, Dave) \\n\\n     The new Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \\nHealth has raised questions about the NIH\\'s commitment to an  effort that uses \\nunorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  The OAM is a small division of \\nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \\nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \\nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \\navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \\nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \\nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \\neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \\nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \\nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \\nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \\ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists\\' \\ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \\nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \\npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \\nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \\nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \\nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \\nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It\\'s only fair to give the \\nOffice time to gel, but  it\\'s up to the public to insist that it\\'s much, much \\nmore [than  public relations].\" \\n======================================================================   \\n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \\nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \\n\\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\\n6 can attack the human immune system\\'s natural killer cells.  This attack \\ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \\nthe immune system\\'s fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \\nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.

Scientists previously knew that the natural \\nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso\\'s  \\nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \\nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \\nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \\nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \\nbody.  Lusso\\'s  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \\nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \\nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV\\'s attack.

Dr. Berkley\\'s editorial on why American doctors  should care \\nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \\nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \\nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \\nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \\nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \\ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \\nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \\non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \\nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \\naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \\nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \\nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \\nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \\nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \\ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \\nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \\ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \\nchange the future of worldwide health. \\n====================================================================   \\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \\n\\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \\nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \\nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \\nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \\nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \\nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \\neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \\nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \\nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \\ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \\ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \\nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \\nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \\nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \\nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \\nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \\nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \\neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \\nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \\nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \\nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \\nhas been the rule.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n     ********************************************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n                                March 29, 1993\\n\\n\\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\\n\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \\nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \\n\\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \\nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \\n\\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \\nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \\nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \\n\\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \\nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \\nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \\ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \\nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \\ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \\nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \\nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \\n\\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.

It will be several years, however, before researchers \\nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \\n\\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \\nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \\ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \\nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\\'s division of AIDS.  \"We need this \\ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \\nHIV infection in children.\" \\n\\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \\nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \\n\\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \\npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \\na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \\nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \\ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \\nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \\n\\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \\nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \\ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \\ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \\nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \\nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \\n\\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \\nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \\nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \\nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \\nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \\n\\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \\nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \\nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \\nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID\\'s division of AIDS. \\n\\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \\nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \\nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We\\'ll also look at \\nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \\nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \\nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nproducts. \\n\\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \\nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \\nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \\n\\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \\nprotein  that gives rise to HIV\\'s surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \\nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.

The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \\ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \\nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \\n\\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \\nchildren.

Although the \\nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals\\' \\nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \\nitself caused the skin disease. \\n\\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \\nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \\nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \\ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \\nRetroviruses. \\n\\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \\nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \\nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \\nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \\n\\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \\neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \\ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \\n\\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \\ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \\nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \\nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \\n\\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \\nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \\nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \\nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \\n\\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \\ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \\ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \\nanimals. \\n\\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \\npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \\non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \\n\\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \\nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \\ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals\\' immune \\nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \\nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \\n\\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \\nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \\ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \\nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \\ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \\nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \\n\\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \\nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \\nDiseases. \\n\\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \\nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \\nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \\nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n                 ********************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n\\n                                 March 4, 1993\\n\\n\\n     HHS Secretary Donna E.

It provides information on \\ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \\nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \\nSan Francisco General Hospital. \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \\nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \\ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \\ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \\ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \\nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \\nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \\ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \\n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \\nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \\nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \\nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \\nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \\nanswered as quickly as possible. \\n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \\nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \\ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \\nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \\ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \\nsources of information or materials. \\n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \\nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \\npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \\ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \\nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \\nmedications, sex, age and the patient\\'s HIV history. \\n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \\nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA\\'s Bureau of Health \\nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \\nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \\n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \\ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \\nRobert G.

Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your\\n   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.\\n\\n2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul).

Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot\\n   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.\\n\\nBesides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties\\nin a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,\\nuntil the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in\\nthe act of shooting when the foul ocured.\\n\\nThis works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most\\nexciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.\\nNext, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can\\ntake a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network\\nannouncers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and\\nMarv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before\\nthe PA announcer says it.\\n\\nOh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play\\ncannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network\\ncan sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told\\nthem who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a \\nchance of pronouncing his name right.\\n\\nSeriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,\\nfor the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is\\nso slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting\\ncontests DURING THE PERIOD!.

The\\ngame is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a\\n10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.\\n\\nThe reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in\\ncommercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.\\nOn TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO.

Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \\n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \\n\\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \\nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \\nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \\nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \\na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \\nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \\ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \\nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \\ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \\nthrough the mistakes they made.  \\n\\nIn article <1993Apr14.171230.16138@kestrel.edu> king@reasoning.com \\n    (Dick King) writes:\\n>  [ Somebody writes: ]\\n>>I doubt if Einstein used any formal methodology.  ....\\n>  ....\\n>He also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a\\n>universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not.\\n>         ....\\n>Einstein played by the rules, which demand that hypotheses only be put out\\n>there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them.\\n\\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\\nsci.psychology.

A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \\nwhich may happen.\\n\\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \\nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t \\nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \\nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \\nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \\nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up \\ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tGo Sabres!\\n\\t\\n\\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\\n\\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu\\n',\n",

Clearly, Finland\\'s top five players (Winnipeg\\'s\\nSelanne & Numminen, Vancouver\\'s Lumme, Los Angeles\\' Jari Kurri and New York\\'s\\nTikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But\\nI have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did\\nwell in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of\\nMarkus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There\\'s\\npresumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn\\'t be superstars at\\nthe highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be\\nthat the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.\\n---\\nSweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.\\nTheir points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa\\'s 22 top\\nplayers combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I\\'d settle for a \\ncompromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during \\nthe first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, \\nthe amateur draft should be open to anyone. \\n\\n> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>  J O O   J O O   J O K E R I T  !  !  !

In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.

He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.

Here are some observations gained from\\npainful experience:\\n\\n  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.\\n     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more\\n     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.\\n\\n  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear\\n     that these things will itch for months.\\n\\n  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of\\n     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,\\n     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could\\n     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC\\'s special\\n     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is\\n     required to get it.\\n\\n  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old\\n     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn\\'t work.  I recall\\n     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers\\n     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I\\n     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some\\n     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.\\n\\n  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.\\n     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally\\n     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is\\n     another preparation called \"Chig Away\" that is a combination of\\n     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was\\n     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In\\n     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get\\n     up on weekends since I literally can\\'t go outside where we\\n     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They\\n     apparently don\\'t like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur\\n     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)\\n\\n  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget\\n     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment\\n     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone\\n     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine\\n     (relieves the itch).  I won\\'t tell you all the things I\\'ve tried.\\n     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this\\n     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think\\n     it gains nothing).\\n\\n  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved\\n     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery\\n     as well.\\n\\nDoctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban\\ndoctors apparently don\\'t encounter them much.  And the rural doctors\\nseem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I\\nsuspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers\\nwould make a *lot* of money.\\n-- \\nGary H.

My definition\\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\\nwork.  Lee Lady writes:\\n\\n> I don\\'t think that science should be defined in a way that some \\n> of the activities that lead to really important science --- namely\\n> thinking and informal exploration --- are not recognized as\\n> scientific work.  \\n\\nUnless one classifies \"thinking and informal exploration\" as a\\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\\nunscientific.  \\n\\nIn article <C5nAsF.MH7@news.Hawaii.Edu> lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu (Lee Lady) writes:\\n> Seriously, I\\'m not sure whether I misjudged you or not, in one respect.  \\n> I still have a major problem, though, with your insistence that science \\n> is mainly about avoiding mistakes. ...\\n\\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\\n\"mainly about.\"\\n\\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\\n\\n> Okay, so let\\'s see if we agree on this: FIRST of all, there are degrees \\n> of certainty.  It might be appropriate, for instance, to demand carefully \\n> controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth (to the \\n> extent that there is any such thing) the effectiveness of a certain \\n> treatment.

As an example of the second, it would only\\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \\n\\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \\n\\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\\n\\n> The folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\n> make this simple test.

When\\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\\nresearchers\\' minds.  \\n\\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\\ndirections for research.

In my field,\\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\\npublication before the dissertation is finished.  (This certainly\\neases one\\'s defense.)\\n\\nFinally, I hope Lee Lady will forgive me from commenting either\\non NLP or the discussion of it in sci.psychology.

All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\\n\\n   [Reproduced without permission]\\n\\n\\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\\n\\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\\n\\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\\n\\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\\n\\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\\n\\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\\n\\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\\n\\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\\n\\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\\n\\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\\n\\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\\n\\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\\n\\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n\\n\\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak\\'s opinions.)\\n\\n',\n",

Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.

It\\'s unethical to\\n\"sacrifice\" humans to check out what effects chronic, acute, etc doses\\nof these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans.  The food\\nindustry knows this.

Certainly\\nthe doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than\\nfor the young, but the additivity of Glu and Asp, and their copious\\nand increased presence in modern processed foods (jointly), and their\\nhidden presence in HVP, necessitates extreme caution. Why would anyone\\nwant to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the\\nendocrine system in adults?

And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\\nhad the same number of points.

I've been seeing \\nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \\nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every \\n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \\nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \\nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \\nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \\nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \\nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \\nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \\nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \\ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \\nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \\nwhen I do need to go out.) \\n\\nAnyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \\nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \\n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \\n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \\nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \\nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \\nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \\nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \\nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \\nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \\nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \\nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \\nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \\nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \\nwasn't as much of a problem.\\n\\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \\nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \\nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \\nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat \\nfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  \\n\\nBut doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat \\nexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \\nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \\nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \\nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \\npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \\na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \\nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \\nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \\nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \\nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \\nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \\nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \\ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \\noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \\nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \\nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \\nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \\nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \\nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \\nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \\nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \\ntemporary for that one week. \\n\\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \\nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \\nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.  I think she \\nassumes I must be eating a high-fat diet, but really it is that \\nbecause of the endometriosis and the operation I'm not able to \\nuse the energy from the food I do eat. \\n\\nAny opinions, info and experiences will be appreciated.  I'm \\ntruly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet \\nbecause fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few \\nminutes and I'll end up having to eat constantly.  Thus far I \\ndon't find any foods satisfying.\\n\\nThanks \\n\\nG\\n\",\n",

Does that make Soderstrom\\'s shutouts less impressive because of\\n> Toronto\\'s lack of offense?\\n\\nYES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.\\nOf course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you\\nget them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you\\'re a\\ncoach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you\\nhave got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn\\'t see the second Toronto\\ngame, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in\\nthat game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn\\'t tested. The same\\nfor Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\ngreat play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\nyou were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\nstand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\ndoesn\\'t have a game like that in him.\\n\\n> Well if you look back to November when Roussel was the #1 goalie (Soderstrom\\n> was being treated for his heart ailment).  The Flyers finished November at\\n> 6-3-1 and were 9-10-4 overall.  And there\\'s no way of knowing where the Flyers\\n> would have finished if Soderstom wasn\\'t wearing the oragne \\'n black.

I would take him over Roussel right now, but I still think Dom has\\n> what it takes to be the #1 guy.  He outperformed Hextall enough during the\\n> \\'91-92 season to make Flyers management think that way too.\\n\\nDon\\'t be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about\\nRoussel, but they don\\'t say too much on the good side either. I\\'ve seen\\nat least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was\\nto have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,\\nDom has played well too.\\n\\n> By the way, what was the final card on Monday night?  Team picture by any\\n> chance?\\n\\nFLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a\\nteam picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the\\nsame picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,\\nKasper...\\n\\n> And how did the Flyers choose the fans who received \"the shirts off our\\n> backs?\"  Winning Recchi\\'s jersey after breaking the club\\'s single season\\n> point record would have been nice.

The OT game winner came from Dimitri\\nYushkevich, just his 5th of the season and his first game winner. The FLYERS\\nnever led up until that point in the game. For the Whalers, the loss marked an\\nNHL record 9th OT loss this season.\\n\\nRoster move:\\n\\nGord Hynes was called to to play in place of Ryan McGill\\n\\nInjuries:\\n\\nRyan McGill injured his hand in a fight 4/15 and was scratched.\\n\\nLines:\\n\\nEklund-Lindros-Recchi\\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\\nFaust-Acton-Brown\\n\\nGalley-Bowen\\nYushkevich-Hawgood\\nCarkner-Hynes\\n\\nDominic Roussel\\n\\nGame Summary:\\n\\nI didn't get TV coverage of the game, and since it was stormy in these parts\\nI didn't have the best radio coverage either. Here's the box score followed by\\na few things I did pick up:\\n\\nFirst Period:\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\\nHar (interference) 18:43\\n\\nSecond Period:\\n\\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\\n\\nThird Period:\\n\\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\\n\\nOvertime:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\\nPenalties - None\\n\\nPower Play:\\n\\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\\n\\nGoalies:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\\n\\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\\n\\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\\n\\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\\n\\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\\nended up behind the goalie.\\n\\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home.

No theoretical argument should be\\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\\n\\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\\nlarge part of the history of science.\\n\\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\\n\\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\\n\\n(I wouldn\\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\\nI don\\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\\n\\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\\nfunction of science: results don\\'t count unless they can be replicated.\\n\\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\\n\\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\\'s irrational motivation had\\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\\n\\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.

As soon as you possibly can.  The\\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\\nthese kinds of problems.  DON\\'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\\n\\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\\na wonderful report by New Zealand\\'s Department of Labour (Occupational\\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner\\'s Guide\".\\n\\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn\\'t have your hands):\\n(note: you\\'re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\\n\\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\\n\\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\\nconditions.  Local problems are what you\\'d expect: specific muscles,\\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\\ntenderness in muscles, although they\\'re not necessarily \"the problem.\"\\n\\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here\\'s the theory.\\n\\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\\nthe blood flow.  By the time you\\'re exerting 50% of your full power,\\nyou\\'re completely restricting your blood flow.\\n\\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\\n\\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\\nand the cycle continues.\\n\\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\\n\\nAnyway, when you\\'re typing too much, you\\'re never really giving a change\\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\\nergonomics, only make things worse.\\n\\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\\n\\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\\n\\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath\\'s ability\\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\\ninflamed, and you\\'ve got your problem.\\n\\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\\nwith repetitive activity.\\n\\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\\n\\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as \\'neural tension\\', this is where\\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \\ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \\n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\\n\\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there\\'s a fancy name for\\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\\n\\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\\n\\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\\nIf you\\'re under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\\nthree minutes.  It\\'s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\\ncalm down, and relax.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what\\'s best\\nfor you.\\n\\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I\\'m lifting it almost verbatim from\\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\\n\\n. Let your shoulders relax.\\n. Let your elbows swing free.\\n. Keep your wrists straight.\\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don\\'t flop your head forward.\\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\\n. Don\\'t slouch or slump forward.\\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\\n\\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \\nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\\n\\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\\nfootrest.\\n\\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\\narea.\\n\\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\\n\\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\\n\\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don\\'t like your chair, go\\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that\\'s right for you.\\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\\nname says it all.\\n\\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\\n\\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\\nshouldn\\'t be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It\\'s\\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\\ndeviated hands.\\n\\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\\n\\n==5== Requests for more info\\n\\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\\nis incomplete.  There\\'s always more information out there.  If you\\'d like\\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I\\'ll gladly throw it in.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\\nwonderful!

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over.

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \\n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\\n\\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\\nto make a number of starts in a row.\\n\\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\\n-steveg@cadkey.com\\n\",\n",

The most recent expansion \\ndrafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction \\nbetween forwards and defensemen.\\n        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down \\nfrom the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and \\nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \\none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \\nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \\nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \\nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \\nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \\nnew teams.\\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \\ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \\nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \\nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \\nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \\nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \\nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \\n1994.\\n\\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \\n1995 draft in Winnipeg.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal).

Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup.

More likely a related reaction. Vomiting\\noccurs as a response to get rid of a noxious compound an organism has\\neaten. If a person can\\'t digest the stuff (entirely possible - the\\nlist of stuff people are allergic to is quite long), and lacks an\\nenzyme to break it down, gastrointestinal distress (stomach or belly\\nache) would be expected.\\n\\n\\n> Some had watery eyes or running nose,\\n\\n\\nThese are respiratory reactions, and are now considered to be similar\\nto vomitting. They are a way for the body to dispose of noxious\\ncompounds. They are adaptiove responses. Of course, it is possible\\nsome other food or environmental compound could be responsible for the\\nsymptoms. But it\\'s important to remember that a lot opf these effets\\ncan be additive, synergystic, subtractive, etc, etc. It would be\\nnecessary to know exactly what was in a dish, and what else the person\\nwas exposed to. Respiratory does sound suspicious BUT  resopiration\\nand heart rate are connected.  Things in the body are far from\\nsimple...very inetractive place, the vertebrate body.\\n \\n> some\\n>had itchy skin or rashes. \\n\\nPeople respond in a myriad of ways to the same compound. It depends\\nupon what it is about the compound that \"pisses off\" their body.\\nPollen, for example, of some plants aggrivates breathing in many\\npeople, because, when inhaled, it sets of the immune system, and an\\nhistamine attack is launched. The immune system goes overboard,\\ncausing the allergic person a lot of misery. And someone with an\\nallergy to some pollens will have trouble with some herb teas that\\ncontain pollens (Chamomile, linden, etc). Drinking the substance can\\nperturb that person\\'s system as much as inhaling it. \\n\\n>More serious accusations include respiration \\n>difficulty \\n\\nSee above. And don\\'t think that heart rate changes, and circulatory\\nproblems are not serious. They can be deadly.\\n\\nand brain damage. \\n\\nThe area of the brain effected is the neuroendocrine system\\ncontrolling the release of gonadotropin, the supra-hormone controlling\\nthe cyclical release of testosterone and estradiol, as well as somatostatin,\\nand other steroids. Testing for effective dose would be, uh, a wee bit unethical.\\n\\n\\n>Now here is a new one: vomiting. My guess is that MSG becomes the number one\\n>suspect of any problem. In this case. it might be just food\\npoisoning. \\n\\nAbsolutely.

Let\\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\\nabove the level of anal effluent.\\n\\n\\n>...Humans have all \\n>kinds of different organisms living in the GI system (mouth, stomach, small \\n>and large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\n>nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\n>system is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\n>the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\n>toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\n>these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\n>residence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\n>happen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\n\\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n>Steve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\n>and vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\n>vitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\n>Elaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n>survives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\n>the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n>some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\n>membrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\n>the candida or not isn\\'t certain.\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n>If it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\n>nondescript.  \\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n>Candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\n>the sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\n>vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\n>ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\n>they broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\n>response will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\n>from their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\n>they were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\n>A does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\n>barrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\n>inflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n>While diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\n>this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\n>knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\n>competition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\n>available to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\n>use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\n>the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\n>inflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\n>antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\n>just as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\n>vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n>In the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\n>reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\n>favorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\n>humidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\n>minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n>If the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\n>blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\n>bloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\n>occurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\n>for occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\n>place.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\n>but her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\n>has told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\n>specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\n>false positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\n>basis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\n>colon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\n>doctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n>...I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\n>GI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\n>patients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n>If taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \\nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\\ntries.\\n\\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \\nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \\nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \\nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\\n\\n1st period: \\n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\\nin \\'his office\\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \\nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\\n\\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\\nthe period.\\n\\n2nd period: \\nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\\n\\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \\nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \\ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \\nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\\n\\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \\nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\\n\\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\\n\\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\\n\\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\\n\\n3rd period:\\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \\ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\\n\\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\\n\\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\\n\\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \\ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\\n\\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \\nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \\na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \\nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \\n8:19) took penalties.  \\n\\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \\npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\\n\\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \\ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \\nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \\nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\\n\\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\\nright out of the game.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\\npenalty killing.\\n\\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\\n\\nNotes:\\n------\\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\\n\\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\\n\\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\\n\\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \\ngames.

       "  'From: accgsg@vaxa.hofstra.edu (Gary Graffagnino)\\nSubject: Isles / Hockey Ramblings\\nLines: 43\\n\\n\\n\\tWell, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \\nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\\n\\n\\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \\nI\\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\\nreferee doesn\\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \\nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\\'t deserve to win in the first place.\\n\\nJust My Honest Opinion,\\n\\nGary at Hofstra\\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET\\n',\n",

Is this North America or isn\\'t it?

As it is now, every time I see\\nthe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I\\'m not a\\nCanucks fan to begin with ;-). \\n\\n    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that\\nI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and\\nsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR\\nNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren\\'t even\\nbetter hockey players. It\\'s all hype. This \"European mystique\" is sickening,\\nbut until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue\\nto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.\\n\\n    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly\\nonly getting worse.\\n\\n    I\\'m all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures\\nand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.\\n\\n    I just don\\'t want them on mine.\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n-- \\nRichard J.

In comparison, in \\nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \\ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \\ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \\nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \\n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \\nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \\nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \\n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \\n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \\nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \\nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \\nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \\nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \\nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \\nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \\ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \\n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \\nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \\nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \\noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \\nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \\nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \\n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \\nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \\nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \\nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \\ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \\nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \\n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \\nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \\nrespectively). \\n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \\nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \\nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \\nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \\n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \\nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \\n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \\nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \\nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \\nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \\nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \\n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \\n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \\nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \\n\\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \\nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, \\nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \\nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \\nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \\nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \\ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \\nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \\ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \\nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \\nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \\nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \\ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \\n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \\nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \\nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \\n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \\ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \\nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \\npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \\n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \\ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \\nand gang affiliation. \\n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \\nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \\n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \\ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \\ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \\nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \\n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \\ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \\npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \\nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \\nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \\nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \\nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \\nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \\ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \\nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \\nand health-care providers. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \\nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \\nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \\nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \\nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \\ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \\noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \\nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \\naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \\nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \\nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \\nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \\nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \\n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \\nstudy. \\n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \\n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \\nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \\nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \\n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \\nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \\nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \\nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \\nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \\nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \\nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \\nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \\nby p values of less than 0.05. \\n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \\n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \\nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \\nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \\nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \\nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \\nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \\nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \\nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \\nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \\nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \\n(no-law states). \\n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \\nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \\nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \\ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \\n43.2%, respectively). \\n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \\nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \\nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \\nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \\n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \\nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \\nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \\nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \\nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \\ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \\n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \\nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \\nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \\nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \\nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \\n\\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \\nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \\nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \\nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \\nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \\nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \\nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \\n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \\nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \\nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \\neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \\nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \\nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \\ndirected at parents with young children. \\n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \\naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \\nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \\nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \\nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \\nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \\nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \\nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \\nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The \\nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \\nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \\nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \\n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \\nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \\nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \\ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \\nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \\nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \\ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \\n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \\ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \\nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \\nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \\npool, or random variation. \\n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \\ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \\nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \\nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \\nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \\nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \\nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \\nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \\n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \\nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \\nA(H1N1). \\n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \\ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \\nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \\namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \\n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \\nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \\ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \\nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \\nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \\nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \\nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \\ntechnology (ART) procedures. \\n\\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \\npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \\nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \\nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \\n\\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \\nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \\nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \\nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \\nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \\ntraditional therapies. \\n\\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \\nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \\nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \\n\\no in vitro \\no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \\n  transfer \\no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \\nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \\ntowards improved success of these technologies. \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n                           Future Areas of Research\\n\\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \\nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \\ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \\ndisease. \\n\\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \\nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \\namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \\n\\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \\nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \\nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \\nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \\nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \\nsex-linked disorders. \\n\\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \\nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \\nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \\nof affected children. \\n\\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\nUniversity of Arizona\\nTucson, Arizona\\n\\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\\n                           Management of Infertility\\n\\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \\nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \\n\\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \\nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \\nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \\nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \\nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \\nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \\nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \\nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \\nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \\nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \\nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \\nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \\nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \\negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \\nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \\nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \\n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \\ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \\nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \\nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \\ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \\nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \\n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \\ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \\nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \\nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \\novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \\nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \\nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \\nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \\ntraditional therapies. \\n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \\nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \\navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \\nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \\nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \\nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \\nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \\nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \\nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \\nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \\nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \\nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \\nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \\n\\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \\nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \\nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \\ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \\noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \\nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \\ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \\npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \\nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \\n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \\nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \\nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \\npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \\nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \\nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \\nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \\npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \\na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \\ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \\nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \\nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \\n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \\nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \\nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \\ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \\n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \\nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \\nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \\nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \\nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \\nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \\nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \\nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \\n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \\nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \\nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \\ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \\npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \\nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \\nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \\nthrough enzymatic digestion. \\n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \\npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \\nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \\nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \\nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \\nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \\noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \\nestablish conception. \\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\n--------- end of part 2 ------------\\n\\n---\\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\\n\",\n",

La directrous de programme est la tete de merde!\\nAnyway, I have a satellite dish, and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming Sunday (25 Apr), and I can\\nnot find correct game times.  For the Calgary at LA game I have times showing\\neverything from 11:00 AM MDT, to 5:00 PM MDT.\\n\\nI am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming Sunday, now\\nthat ABC has mucked up the schedule.  I think I should be able to\\npull in\\nthree games (11:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 5:30 pm MDT) off the dish, but I am\\nnot sure.\\n\\nIF anybody has a schedule, pleas emial it to me.  As you can see, I have to\\ntelent to get rec.sport.hockey, and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.\\n\\nThanks in advance\\nMerci d'avance\\n\\nP.S.

I can\\'t \\nremember him having any as of yet.)\\n\\nWell, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris\\nhas truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and\\nToronto.

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`~sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n=================   ==========\\nClasses                     20\\nSamples total            18846\\nDimensionality               1\\nFeatures                  text\\n=================   ==========\\n\\n.. dropdown:: Usage\\n\\n  The :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\n  fetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\n  the original `20 newsgroups website <http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/>`__,\\n  extracts the archive contents\\n  in the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n  :func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\n  testing set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n    >>> from pprint import pprint\\n    >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n    [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n     \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n     \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n     \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n     \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n     \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n     \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n     \\'rec.autos\\',\\n     \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n     \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n     \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n     \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n     \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n     \\'sci.med\\',\\n     \\'sci.space\\',\\n     \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n     \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n     \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n     \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n     \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\n  The real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\n  attribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n    (11314,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n    (11314,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n    array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\n  It is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\n  list of the categories to load to the\\n  :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n    >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n    >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n    [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n    (1073,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n    (1073,)\\n    >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n    array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\n.. dropdown:: Converting text to vectors\\n\\n  In order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\n  one first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\n  for statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n  ``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\n  example that extract `TF-IDF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf>`__ vectors\\n  of unigram tokens from a subset of 20news::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n    >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n    ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n    ...                                       categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n    >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n    >>> vectors.shape\\n    (2034, 34118)\\n\\n  The extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\n  components by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n  (less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n    >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n    159.01327...\\n\\n  :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which\\n  returns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. dropdown:: Filtering text for more realistic training\\n\\n  It is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n  20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\n  high F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\n  aren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\n  For example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\n  which is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n    >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n    >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.88213...\\n\\n  (The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\n  the training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\n  multinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\n  yet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\n  Let\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n    >>> import numpy as np\\n    >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n    ...     feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()\\n    ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n    ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n    ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n    ...\\n    >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n    alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n    comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n    sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n    talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\n  You can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n  - Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n    ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n  - Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n    a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n  - The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n    previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n    wrote:\"\\n  - Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n    were posting at the time.\\n\\n  With such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\n  barely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\n  same high level.\\n\\n  For this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\n  parameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\n  of each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n  ``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\n  blocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n    ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                      categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.77310...\\n\\n  This classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\n  metadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\n  It loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n    >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n    ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n    ...                                       categories=categories)\\n    >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n    >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n    >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n    MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n    >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n    >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n    >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n    0.76995...\\n\\n  Some other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try the\\n  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n  example with and without the `remove` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. rubric:: Data Considerations\\n\\nThe Cleveland Indians is a major league baseball team based in Cleveland,\\nOhio, USA. In December 2020, it was reported that \"After several months of\\ndiscussion sparked by the death of George Floyd and a national reckoning over\\nrace and colonialism, the Cleveland Indians have decided to change their\\nname.\" Team owner Paul Dolan \"did make it clear that the team will not make\\nits informal nickname -- the Tribe -- its new team name.\" \"It\\'s not going to\\nbe a half-step away from the Indians,\" Dolan said.\"We will not have a Native\\nAmerican-themed name.\"\\n\\nhttps://www.mlb.com/news/cleveland-indians-team-name-change\\n\\n.. rubric:: Recommendation\\n\\n- When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this\\n  by setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n- This text dataset contains data which may be inappropriate for certain NLP\\n  applications. An example is listed in the \"Data Considerations\" section\\n  above. The challenge with using current text datasets in NLP for tasks such\\n  as sentence completion, clustering, and other applications is that text\\n  that is culturally biased and inflammatory will propagate biases. This\\n  should be taken into consideration when using the dataset, reviewing the\\n  output, and the bias should be documented.\\n\\n.. rubric:: Examples\\n\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_plot_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_hashing_vs_dict_vectorizer.py`\\n* :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_clustering.py`\\n'}"
